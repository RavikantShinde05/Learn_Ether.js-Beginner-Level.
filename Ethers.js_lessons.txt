The structure of the ethers v5.7 documentation can be organized into the following chapters to facilitate easier learning and understanding of concepts and commands:
Chapter 1: Getting Started and Foundational Concepts:
This chapter focuses on setting up the library and understanding the core terminology of the Ethereum ecosystem and the ethers.js library.
• Getting Started: Includes steps for Installing and Importing the library.
• Ethereum Basics: Covers Common Terminology, Events, Logs and Filtering, and Solidity Topics.
• Connecting to Ethereum: Details connecting via MetaMask and direct RPC connections.
• Security Features: Introduction to Security, including Side-Channel Attacks and Key Derivation Functions, emphasizing that the library is designed to keep your private keys safe in your client.
Chapter 2: Network Operations and Resource Management:
This section dives into the practical aspects of interacting with the Ethereum network, focusing on transaction resources and best practices.
• Gas Management: Covers the concepts of Gas, Gas Price, and Gas Limit.
• Best Practices: Includes important considerations for handling Network Changes.
• Provider API Keys: Discusses how to use API providers such as Etherscan, INFURA, Alchemy, Pocket Gateway, and Ankr, and how to create a Default Provider.
Chapter 3: Providers: Connecting and Retrieving Data:
This chapter focuses on the Application Programming Interface (API) related to Providers, which are essential for reading data from the blockchain.
• Provider Types: Detailed review of the main Provider class, JsonRpcProvider, and other specific API Providers like InfuraProvider, AlchemyProvider, and CloudflareProvider.
• Provider Methods: Explores methods covering Accounts, Blocks, Logs, Network Status, and Transactions.
• Advanced Providers: Examination of specialized options such as FallbackProvider, Web3Provider, and WebSocketProvider.
Chapter 4: Signers and Identity Management:
This chapter covers the components responsible for sending transactions and managing cryptographic keys.
• Signers: Detailed coverage of the Signer type, including Wallet, VoidSigner, and ExternallyOwnedAccount.
• Key Management: Includes methods for importing and exporting JSON wallets (Geth, Parity) and working with BIP 39 mnemonic phrases and HD Wallets.
• Signing: Covers the process of Signing Messages.
Chapter 5: Contract Interaction:
This critical chapter details how to define, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the network.
• Contract Classes: Focus on the Contract and ContractFactory types.
• Instance Management: Covers Creating Instances, Properties, Methods, and Events for contracts.
• Meta-classes: Understanding how meta-classes create JavaScript objects from any contract ABI, supporting ABIv2 and Human-Readable ABI.
• Example Usage: Includes the Example: ERC-20 Contract section, illustrating deployment and connecting to contracts.
Chapter 6: Utilities and Data Manipulation:
This expansive chapter covers the necessary tools for encoding, decoding, formatting, and mathematical operations.
• Application Binary Interface (ABI): In-depth look at AbiCoder, ABI Formats (Human-Readable ABI, Solidity JSON ABI), and Fragments (FunctionFragment, EventFragment).
• Data Types: Covers BigNumber manipulation, Byte Manipulation, and FixedNumber.
• Hashing and Addresses: Details Cryptographic Hash Functions, Solidity Hashing Algorithms, and Addresses (Formats, Conversion, Verification).
• Ethereum Naming Service (ENS): Explains how ENS names are treated as first-class citizens and can be used anywhere an Ethereum address is valid.
Chapter 7: Advanced Development Topics:
This chapter covers specialized tools, integrations, and experimental features.
• Language Support: TypeScript preparation, including definition files and full TypeScript source.
• Other Libraries: Overview of Assembly and Ethers ASM Dialect.
• Hardware Integration: Includes documentation for hardware wallets like LedgerSigner.
• Command Line Interfaces: Use of the Sandbox Utility and Assembler tools.
Chapter 8: Maintenance, Migration, and Resources:
This final section offers guidance on integrating the library into various environments and upgrading from previous versions.
• Cookbook: Practical examples, including specific instructions for React Native (and ilk).
• Migration Guide: Details for moving from Web3.js and Ethers v4 to Ethers v5.
• Testing: Information on Test Suites and Supported Platforms.
